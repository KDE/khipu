About Khipu
===========
- Khipu is an advanced Mathematical function plotter application of KDE Education Project. 
- It is a replacement for KmPlot.
- The basic idea of Khipu is to help teachers and Professors in understanding the behaviour of mathematical functions,surfaces etc.
- Khipu can work in both 2D and 3D space.

Basic Features
==============
- Khipu can draw any 2D and 3D plots supported by Analitza (A mathematical library that Khipu uses for its backend)
- User can save their work in .khipu file and later he/she can restore the work
- If khipu is closed accidentally , the autosave feature will let the user to restore the unsaved work of the previous session.
- User can add the plots from the files known as Plot-Dictionary file (.plots files). These files contain the name and equation of the plot. 
  So, user does not have to type a big equation rather, he/she can plot the function from its name.
- User can hide/show the plots and also he/she can remove/edit the existing plots.
- User can save the plots as PNG image and also take the snapshot of the plots into the clipboard.
- Aprat from this, khipu has numberous features to work with mathematical functions and spaces.

Backend Information
====================
- Analitza is a library that work with mathematical objects. 
- Analitza add mathematical features to your program, such as symbolic computations and some numerical methods; 
  for instance the library can parse mathematical expressions and let you evaluate and draw them.

How To Build/Run Khipu
===================
- To successfully build the application, you need the following packages installed on your system
1) Analitza 	(sudo apt-get install  analitza-dev)
2) QJson 	(sudo apt-get install libqjson-dev)
3) libkdeedu 	(sudo apt-get install libkdeedu-dev)

- To build the application,you need to type the following commands on the command prompt.
1) cd <project_name_path>
2) mkdir build
